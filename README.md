# Scraping-Linkedin-Profile-Using-Python-Selenium
Our goal is to use Selenium and Python to scrape LinkedIn profiles [name, job_title, schools, location, linkedIn_url] and store them in a CSV file 

The workflow for scraping the job is as follow:
1) Selenium Login to Linkedin
2) Go to Google 
3) Filtering profiles by means of Google 
4) Access each Linkedin profile from Google then save to CSV
